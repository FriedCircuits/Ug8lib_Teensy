UG8LIB Teensy COM Add on
=============================

This is the needed COM files to use U8GLIB with HW SPI. 
Make sure you have Teensy loader and libraries installed.

U8GLIB is from 
[https://code.google.com/p/u8glib/](https://code.google.com/p/u8glib/)

I don't take credit for completely writing the COM files. I did a lot of research and this is what I ended up with.
If this was yours, please let me know and I will add your name here.
